# Newman_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project

For this project I am goint to create a board game. The player will compete against a chosen number of computer players to see who can rack up the most points traveling around the board. The movent amount will be based on a random number creator like a dice. The data structure I plan on using will be a linked list for the board and a struct for teach player. The board will be a random size each game and have semi random spots on the board. The board will displayed using ascii characters.
